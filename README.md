# REST-MYSQL-NAV

This is a fork of REST-MYSQL; but adds some dynamics..

This is an example of a generic REST service wrapper using NodeJS/Express that integrates
a static HTML/AngularJS page to serve content..

1. npm install
2. Edit the credentials, etc for the DB connection
3. Tables will be automagically setup
4. The server expects the 1st field of the table to be the PK
5. Search for FIXME in the code for places to modify
6. npm start
7. http://server:port/
